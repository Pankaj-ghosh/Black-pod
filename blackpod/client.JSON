She even took the time to explain to me page by page about some documents I received from the seller, which by the way it was on her spare time to answer all of my concerns about those documents. She responded on every email and text that I had questions and concerns and I got answers. The closing went smoothly and on point with all of the documents that had to be signed. Irene made herself accessible and told me if I have any other closing related issues pertaining any documents to give her a call. Thank you once again on doing a great job. I would highly recommend Irene Stein and her firm."

I was worried we would lose everything but Claire got us sorted out after just a couple of meetings. I wish she had been cheaper and that this all never happened. But Claire made us feel a lot better while she worked. I’d hire her again."
